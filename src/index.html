        <div class="mainText">As the art world changes, so do the different forms of art. In fact, with the arrival of different types of art throughout the ages, the notion of the seven significant forms of art has been altered several times with the arrival of new media. Furthermore, today when we speak of ‘art’ we all think of ‘visual art’ to be more specific. However, this was not the case.
          The seven different art forms are Painting, Sculpture, Literature, Architecture, Theater, Film, and Music. However, back in the day, the seven different art forms were called the Liberal Arts, consisting of Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, and Music.

            <h3>Modern Art</h3>
            <p>Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the styles and philosophies of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation.

            <h3>Wall Art</h3>
            <p>Wall Art (or Paleolithic Art) is a broad term for the earliest known art-making in human history. This movement is perhaps best-known today for the paintings found on the walls of many prehistoric caves, rich in depictions of animals, human figures, and forms that are a combination of man and beast.
